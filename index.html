      <p style="--n: 1">Hi.</p>
      <p style="--n: 2">
        I’ve been thinking for a long time about whether to say this, and I
        finally decided to be honest.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 3">
        I like you. I have for a long time. I never spoke because fear, timing,
        and responsibilities always stopped me — not because I didn’t care. I
        don’t expect anything from you, and I don’t want to make you
        uncomfortable. I just didn’t want to carry this silently anymore.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 4">
        People say we should control our feelings, our emotions, our thoughts. I
        tried. I really did. But some feelings grow quietly, without asking
        permission. This is my truth.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 5">
        The first time I heard your name was in the Bee Lab. From that day,
        something started inside me — something I didn’t understand then. I saw
        you often, yet you never noticed me. I existed somewhere in the
        background of your days.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 6">
        In our first year, we shared the same supply exam. We sat in the same
        classroom, both wearing green. I still remember that small coincidence.
        You moved forward in life so easily after that, clearing everything,
        while I carried small memories you never knew existed.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 7">
        In the second year, we were in the CC lab. You sat in front of me. I saw
        you without being seen. One day, when you stood near madam for
        correction, your hair fell over your eyes. It was a simple moment, but
        it stayed with me.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 8">
        Another day, at the hostel mess, I noticed you sitting alone with your
        phone. For days, I saw you there. Then one day, our eyes met. That was
        our first eye contact. I don’t know if you remember it — but I do.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 9">
        The third year was different. Slowly, you began to notice me too. One
        day, my system didn’t work, and I was moved to the system beside yours.
        For two hours, we sat next to each other without speaking. I wanted to
        say something so badly, but fear froze me. My body was there; my courage
        wasn’t.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 10">
        Over time, small moments made me feel closer to you — shared looks,
        quiet smiles. During sports time, when madam asked us to say each
        other’s names, you smiled at me. That smile stayed with me longer than
        you’ll ever know.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 11">Still, I remained silent.</p>

      <p style="--n: 13">
        After a long time, I gathered the courage to send you a follow request.
        When you accepted it, my heart felt lighter. During exams, whenever you
        came near me, my heartbeat fast Even now, it does.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 14">
        There were moments that made me feel close to you — songs, shared
        colors, small interactions, birthday wishes. I promised myself I would
        talk to you one day. But life became heavy. Family responsibilities
        grew. I felt I wasn’t enough, that I wasn’t suitable for you. So I
        stayed silent again.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 15">
        When college started, I ignored you even when you looked at me. I know
        that hurt you, and I am truly sorry. That distance was never because I
        didn’t care — it was because I cared too much and didn’t know how to
        survive that phase of my life.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 16">
        I only questioned myself — my silence, my fear, my timing.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 17">
        I tried to move on. I tried to stop looking, stop feeling. But my heart
        refused to listen.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 18">
        One morning, I waited, wanting to finally speak. But when I saw your
        face, I felt like my presence was unwanted. So I stepped back again and
        created distance — not out of indifference, but out of self-protection.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 19">
        From the outside, I looked fine. Inside, I was slowly breaking.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 20">
        You live in my thoughts in ways I can’t explain. Songs remind me of you.
        Dreams carry your face. Even in rooms full of people, my mind drifts
        back to you.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 21">
        I don’t know if I will ever have you. I don’t expect anything from you.
        I only believe this — if you are meant to be part of my life, life will
        find a way.
      </p>
      <p style="--n: 22">
        Thank you for reading this. Just writing it has been a relief. I hope
        this message finds you well. If I anything hurt you, sorry.
      </p>
